# Introduction 

Open source is all about collaboration. It's about sharing ideas, building amazing things, and making software accessible to everyone. But a truly thriving open source community is one that's inclusive and welcoming.

This handbook is your guide to implementing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in your open source project or community.

## Target Audience
This DEI handbook is designed for everyone involved in open-source communities:
- Newcomers: We provide a gentle introduction to DEI concepts and best practices specifically tailored to the open source context.
- Community leads: We offer guidance on how to champion DEI initiatives within your projects and communities.
- Open Source Event organisers:

If you do find a piece of jargon or terminology with which you arenâ€™t familiar, please see the detailed Glossary and FAQs (frequently asked questions) which can be found at the end of the handbook. The authors intend to broaden the scope of this content as time permits. You are welcome to participate and help us with that effort.
